Team meetings in CSE2 374 at 2 pm Thursdays.


## Team Report 



* Goals from Last Week: First week, nothing to write here
* Report on Progress and Issues: 
    * This week was primarily focused on planning for the project, we finished the design doc (version 1) and set up a rudimentary github repo. There weren't any major issues that we got stuck on, any issues were resolved with good discussion or talking to the team manager. It became quickly apparent that some of the team members had conflicting views of what D&D is, but we have started to share standardized resources for us all to review and ensure we are on the same page. We also confirmed a time (2pm) and meeting place (CSE2 374) with our Project Manager, Thomas for Thursday.
* Goals for the Week:
    * Make the GitHub Repo more structured (front-end/back-end split, more comprehensive README. 
    * Complete the Git setup assignment for 4/19.
    * Make a mock UI so we all have the same idea of the layout of the application.
    * We all have research to do, the topics of which are discussed below
    * Have discussions about work flow and set up JIRA/sprint tracker

* Report on Progress and Issues: (paragraph, free response, talk about your feelings)
    * Hunter- I worked on fleshing out the technology that we would be using and talked to the team about how to implement some of them. I also set up the JIRA so we can start grouping backlogs into sprints. I think there is going to be a lot of logic that is going to be hard to implement when choosing characters and having rolls happen. I think we split up the rolls pretty well but actually learning how to split each task is going to be a learning experience. I am excited to work with this team and see how we do in our first week. 
    * Joan - I worked with the team making project plans and policies, and discussed project goals and features last week. I started researching and learning about D&D games. I have worked on the user case and set up a git account. One of the challenges in the first week for me was to learn all the rules of the D&D game. Fortunately, our team members helped a lot by providing instruction manuals and relevant online resources. Without any previous experience, I found it to be exciting but difficult at the same time to learn/understand the job responsibilities as a frontend developer. 
    * Steven - I worked on the design doc, editing and adding minor things, and I worked on my use-case. I started to research what numeric information may be necessary/sufficient for the application’s core functionality. I also started to think about possible system design/architecture for the back-end. I used some amalgam of the example use-case formats on the slides to write my use-case, and I think this was a great exercise for starting to think about important details of the application. I don’t feel stuck on anything at this point, but I think my use-case could use some refining and possibly more/better structure. I feel good about the project overall at this stage.
    * Allie - I provided background information to the group to help everyone have a consistent understanding of what information is necessary to create a DnD character and perform various kinds of roles. I helped brainstorm the use cases, and went through the “game logic” in everyone’s use case to make sure it was consistent and correct. I worked through my own use case, trying to flesh out the main success scenario, alternate courses, and error scenarios. It gave me a much better understanding of what the various aspects are that we’ll need to code! I worked on helping come up with the rough schedule for thinking about completing parts of the project. \

    * Jacob - I worked on the design doc, usually acting as scribe during our meetings. Besides in class work I attended two meetings on Sunday to work on the design doc. I also set up the GitHub repo for this group and added all members. I will need to brush up on how GitHub works so I can maintain the repo well as the “owner.” I finished my required use case. I got a little stuck on the use case, but reviewing the lecture where we talked about them helped. I think we should have more use cases as we progress as it establishes an explicit definition of what we are trying to accomplish. In general, I feel like we are in a good spot to advance in this project. \

* Goals for the week: (bullet points)
    * Hunter
        * Set up front end environment
        * Start grouping for backlog in front end. 
        * Converse with group to make sure environment is set up in their machines
    * Joan
        * Review frontend tool – React NodeGUI and Git knowledge
        * Set up front end environment
        * Continue to study guideline and essential rules of the game 
        * Start working on UI design (probably start with character sheet)   
    * Steven
        * Filter game rules down to a set of numbers that influence the outcomes of in-game events, and determine what is necessary and sufficient to track these numbers across the set of in-game events that we plan to handle in the application
        * refine/update my use-case, possibly add more use-cases as they come to mind
        * Review Git knowledge
        * Decide on IDE for back-end programming
        * Give input on UI design where appropriate
        * Plan a schedule for how to approach designing/coding up the back-end with Allie and Jacob
    * Allie
        * Review Git knowledge
        * Discuss back-end work flow and collaboration policies with Steven and Jacob
        * Determine “product backlog” for backend with Steven and Jacob
        * Determine priority queue of product backlog
        * Begin compiling “tables of knowledge” for the different choices users have in creating a character
    * Jacob
        * Learn more about React NodeGUI and what might need to be done to set up my front end environment.
        * Talk with Hunter and Joan about our workflow/collaboration policy for frontend
        * Talk with Allie and Steven about our workflow/collaboration policy for backend
        * Plan out exactly what kind of mix of front/back end I want/need to do (more front end? More backend?) 
        * Review Git knowledge (specifically git merging and branches)
