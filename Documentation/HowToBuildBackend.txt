Step 1: clone the repo from https://github.com/cse403RollBuddy/Main.git or git@github.com:cse403RollBuddy/Main.git

Step 2: from the command line, navigate to the root directory of the git project (e.g., C:\some\directory\Main)

Step 3: from the command line, issue the command 'gradlew' (i.e., type './gradlew' without the quotes and press enter)

Step 4: at this point, if there were no issues, you should be able to issue the command 'gradlew build' (same way
        as above) and see...

            BUILD SUCCESSFUL in 2s
            5 actionable tasks: 5 executed


        ... At this point the gradle build system is working for our backend system
        on your machine. Hooray!

To set the web server up on your machine listening on port 4567 (i.e., https://localhost:4567):
    issue the command 'gradlew run' (e.g. ./gradlew run). You should see something like...

        > Task :run
        [main] INFO RollBuddy Server - Listening on: http://localhost:4567
        [Thread-0] INFO org.eclipse.jetty.util.log - Logging initialized @237ms to org.eclipse.jetty.util.log.Slf4jLog
        [Thread-0] INFO spark.embeddedserver.jetty.EmbeddedJettyServer - == Spark has ignited ...
        [Thread-0] INFO spark.embeddedserver.jetty.EmbeddedJettyServer - >> Listening on 0.0.0.0:4567
        [Thread-0] INFO org.eclipse.jetty.server.Server - jetty-9.4.31.v20200723; built: 2020-07-23T17:57:36.812Z; git: 450ba27947e13e66baa8cd1ce7e85a4461cacc1d; jvm 11.0.1+13-LTS
        [Thread-0] INFO org.eclipse.jetty.server.session - DefaultSessionIdManager workerName=node0
        [Thread-0] INFO org.eclipse.jetty.server.session - No SessionScavenger set, using defaults
        [Thread-0] INFO org.eclipse.jetty.server.session - node0 Scavenging every 660000ms

        [Thread-0] INFO org.eclipse.jetty.server.Server - Started @722ms

    ... which means that the server is running on your machine. You can verify this by opening a browser and
    entering "http://localhost:4557/hello", at which point the browser should display "Hello world".
    Known Issue: there is no clean way to shut the server down right now, so you will need to send an OS
                 interrupt (usually ctrl-c from the command line) to shut it down right now. If you are running
                 the gradle task from an IDE, you can probably shut down the server using some button, at which
                 point you will be informed of something like "Execution failed for task ':run'"; this is okay
                 for now until we figure out a nice way to shut the server down cleanly. Gradle just doesn't like
                 that it initiated execution of a task that ended with an OS interrupt (I think).

PROBLEMS?? Contact Jacob, Steve, or Allie (they set the damn thing up).
