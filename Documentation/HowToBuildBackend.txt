Step 1: clone the repo from https://github.com/cse403RollBuddy/Main.git or git@github.com:cse403RollBuddy/Main.git

Step 2: from the command line, navigate to the root directory of the git project (e.g., C:\some\directory\Main)

Step 3: from the command line, issue the command 'gradlew' (i.e., type './gradlew' without the quotes and press enter)

Step 4: at this point, if there were no issues, you should be able to issue the command 'gradlew run' (same way
        as above) and see...

            >Task :run
            hello!

            BUILD SUCCESSFUL in ns
            z actionable tasks: x executed, y up-to-date

        ... for some numbers n, x, y, z. At this point the gradle build system is working for our backend system
        on your machine. Hooray!
